# Capstone-Project---Part-I. 
## Star Wars Planet Weather App (Name TBD in process) 

### Mission statement
Our mission at Galaxy Far, Far Away Forecast is giving Star Wars fans a laugh and entertaining them with cleverness, energy and whimsy.
Providing Weather forecast for all the Planets in the Star Wars Galaxy in a fun and creative way. 

### MVP
**MVP requirement = The project idea should only depend on rendering information from arrays of objects.**
As required in the MVP, the app I will be working on will make use of the Star Wars arrays that we have been using for several class assignments.
Using Insomnia to open the API https://swapi.dev/api/planets, I will choose what data to use from the information received to create an array.
I will create interfaces based on my needs from the information receive and information I will add. 
My app will access an array of Planets and the users can find weather forecast for each Planet. 

The forecast will include the following:
weather conditions;
wind (speed and direction);
temperature (for day and night).
I will have a weather component.
I will have a forecast interface.

### Wireframe of your application
This to me is the hardest part. I have a basic idea but I am sure it will change. I still need to see what Angular Material and possibly MDBootstrap can do for my layout and design. 

### Libraries 
* Angular Material
  * specially designed for Angular projects
  * easy to implement
  * based on twelve column grid system
  * fully responsive 

### Stretch Goal Alert = Incorporating a new technology not taught in the course, Responsive mobile design
  * MDBootstrap - world's most popular Material Design framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites & apps.
  

### Post MVP
  * Make App responsive
  * Style and Design - advance in comparison to any of my other project
  * User-Centric - keep UI/UX in mind will creating app and styling app 
  
### Projected Schedule
