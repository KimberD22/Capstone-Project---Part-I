# Capstone-Project---Part-I. 
## Pet Planet e-commerce app

### Mission statement
Our mission at Pet Planet is sourcing healthy, safe, and fun products for your furry, fluffy, or feathered family member with care, thoughtfulness and trust

### MVP
**MVP requirement = The project idea should only depend on rendering information from arrays of objects.**
This project will be an e-commerce site for pet items.
I will have array of items for sale at the site.
There will be a search function for users to select from the array. 

### Wireframe of your application
This to me is the hardest part. I have a basic idea but I am sure it will change. I still need to see what Angular Material and possibly MDBootstrap can do for my layout and design. 

### Libraries 
* Angular Material
  * specially designed for Angular projects
  * easy to implement
  * based on twelve column grid system
  * fully responsive 

### Stretch Goal Alert = Incorporating a new technology not taught in the course, Responsive mobile design
  * MDBootstrap - world's most popular Material Design framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites & apps.
  

### Post MVP
  * Make App responsive
  * Style and Design - advance in comparison to any of my other project
  * User-Centric - keep UI/UX in mind will creating app and styling app
